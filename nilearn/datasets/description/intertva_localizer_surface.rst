InterTVA localizer surface


Notes
-----
A subset of the InterTVA data set, dedicated to run the example of the surface-based searchlight of nilearn.
The InterTVA data set aims at studying the inter-individual differences observed in people's
ability at performing voice perception and voice identification tasks. Here, you get a set of pre-processed maps from a
single subject recorded during a voice localizer paradigm. The subjects passively listened to 144 sounds, half vocal,
half non-vocal.
Here, we provide 144 beta maps that have been estimated using a within-subject GLM where one regressor was included for
each trial, and projected onto the fsaverage5 surface.
